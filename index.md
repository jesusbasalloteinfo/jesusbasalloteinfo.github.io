# üõ∞ Astronomical Software Suite

As an astronomy enthusiast and C++ developer, I‚Äôve created a **cross-platform suite of astronomical applications** designed to deliver accurate data and clean visualizations of celestial phenomena. This suite includes three specialized tools, all featuring graphical interfaces built with **wxWidgets**:


## üåï Lunaris: Lunar Astronomical Calculator

A **Lunar calculator** that provides data such as the current position of the Moon, its phase, moonrise and moonset times, and the dates of upcoming new and full moons. 
It includes a graphical viewer with a realistic representation of the Moon's phase.

More information can be found [here](./lunaris.html)

## ‚òÄÔ∏è HelioMetrica: Solar Data Analyser

A **solar tool** that offers the Sun‚Äôs position, sunrise and sunset times, solstice and equinox events, and a sky viewer with realistic lighting. Ideal for studying the solar cycle and its annual evolution.

## ü™ê PlanexiScope: Planetary Ephemeris Tool

A **planetary analyzer** capable of computing ephemerides for any planet in the solar system, including geocentric and heliocentric positions, rise and set times, and dates of perihelion and aphelion. It includes a powerful orbital viewer with multiple viewing modes.

# üÉè *Seven and a Half* ‚Äì Small Card Game (HTML, CSS, JS)

As a side project, I developed a small web-based version of the classic card game **Seven and a Half** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game is designed to be simple, modern, and interactive, with a focus on user experience.

It has the following features:

- **Single-player mode**: Play against a CPU opponent that makes strategic decisions based on the current game state.
- **Event log window**: A dynamic log that records and displays game actions in real time (draws, scores, CPU decisions, and game results).
- **Animated card visuals**: Cards are generated with pleasant animations, enhancing the visual feedback during gameplay.
- **Modern user interface**: Clean design with a polished UI layout fully playable on desktop browsers.

This project showcases DOM manipulation, basic AI logic for the CPU, animation techniques with CSS/JS, and state management for a turn-based game.
