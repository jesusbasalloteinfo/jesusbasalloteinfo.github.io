# 🌌 Astronomical Software Suite

As an astronomy enthusiast and C++ developer, I’ve created a **cross-platform suite of astronomical applications** designed to deliver accurate data and clean visualizations of celestial phenomena. 

## Key Features
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform Design**: The suite is designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind (Windows, Linux and macOS), _**although it is currently only available for Windows**_.
- 🌐 **Multilingual Interface**: Available in multiple languages to make the tools accessible to a broader astronomical community _(available in Catalan, Spanish and English)_.
- 🔬 **Scientific Accuracy**: All data is generated using **real-time astronomical calculations**, with no precomputed tables involved.  
  > This approach ensures higher accuracy, adaptability, and consistency across time and location, while also allowing for more flexible simulations.

This suite includes three specialized tools, all featuring graphical interfaces built with [**wxWidgets**](https://www.wxwidgets.org/):

## 🌕 Lunaris: Lunar Astronomical Calculator

A **Lunar calculator** that provides data such as the current position of the Moon, its phase, moonrise and moonset times, and the dates of upcoming new and full moons. 
It includes a graphical viewer with a realistic representation of the Moon's phase.

## ☀️ HelioMetrica: Solar Data Analyser

A **Solar tool** that offers the Sun’s position, sunrise and sunset times, solstice and equinox events, and a sky viewer with realistic lighting. Ideal for studying the solar cycle and its annual evolution.

## 🪐 PlanexiScope: Planetary Ephemeris Tool

A **Planetary analyzer** capable of computing ephemerides for any planet in the solar system, including geocentric and heliocentric positions, rise and set times, and dates of perihelion and aphelion. It includes a powerful orbital viewer with multiple viewing modes.

# 🖥️ Self-Hosted Private Server

As a personal tech project, I set up a **self-hosted private server** at home, running multiple services to explore system administration, network configuration, and service deployment. Everything runs on a Linux-based machine with proper port management and access controls.

The server is fully accessible **from anywhere on the Internet** via **secure HTTPS connections**, thanks to remote access configuration, dynamic DNS, and encrypted reverse proxy routing.

### Services Included:

- 🎞️ **Media Server (Jellyfin)** – Streams my personal media (movies, music, TV shows) across my devices.
- 🌐 **Web Server (Apache and Nginx)** – Hosts static and dynamic content, and also acts as a **reverse proxy** to route specific URLs to the internal services, making access seamless and centralized via friendly web addresses instead.
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage (Nextcloud)** – A private cloud platform for syncing files, calendars, and notes, accessible from any device.
- 🧬 **Git Server (Gitea)** – A lightweight, self-hosted Git service to manage my private code repositories with a clean web interface.

This setup has given me full control over my data, while also providing me a deeper understanding of service hosting and the opportunity to experiment with configurations and automation for greater flexibility.
